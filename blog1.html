<div class="about2">

<p>The human skin is the outer covering of the body. In humans, 
it is the largest organ of the integumentary system.
 The skin has multiple layers of ectodermal tissue and guards
 the underlying muscles, bones, ligaments and internal organs.
 Human skin is similar to that of most other mammals. Though nearly 
 all human skin is covered with hair follicles, it can appear hairless. 
 There are two general types of skin, hairy and glabrous skin.
 The adjective cutaneous literally means "of the skin" (from Latin cutis, skin).
 Because it interfaces with the environment, skin plays an important immunity role 
 in protecting the body against pathogens and excessive water loss.Its
 other functions are insulation, temperature regulation, sensation, synthesis 
 of vitamin D, and the protection of vitamin B folates. Severely damaged skin 
 will try to heal by forming scar tissue. This is often discolored and depigmented.
In humans, skin pigmentation varies among populations, and skin type can range from 
dry to oily. Such skin variety provides a rich and diverse habitat for bacteria that 
number roughly 1000 species from 19 phyla, present on the human skin.Skin has mesodermal cells,
 pigmentation, such as melanin provided by melanocytes, which absorb some of the potentially
 dangerous ultraviolet radiation (UV) in sunlight. It also contains DNA repair enzymes that
 help reverse UV damage, such that people lacking the genes for these enzymes suffer high rates 
 of skin cancer. One form predominantly produced by UV light, malignant melanoma, is particularly 
 invasive, causing it to spread quickly, and can often be deadly. Human skin pigmentation varies 
 among populations in a striking manner. This has led to the classification of people(s) on the
 basis of skin color.</p>
